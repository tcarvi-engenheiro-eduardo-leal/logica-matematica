Statements:
q: "a" belongs to the set of positive integers
r: "b" belongs to the set of positive integers

- By the definitions of Set Theory, we can prove the existence of "a". And say "q" is true.
- By the definitions of Set Theory, we can prove the existence of "b". And say "r" is true.

Statement:
s: a > b
- By the principle of induction, we can say that there are elements greater than other elements in the set of positive integers. Then we can say that a > b is possible and that there are elements "a" and "b" where the statement "s" is true. So we can say that "s" can be true or false. But taking some values for "a" and "b", which we decided to choose, the statement "s" is true. Thus, by proving the existence of "a" and "b" in this expression and choosing specific values for "a" and "b", we can say that the statement "s" is true.

We would like to prove the logical sentence:
if a > b then aˆ2 > b^2
Or, using logic symbols, a>b -> aˆ2>bˆ2
From the truth table of the conditional operator we know the following truth table:
s t s->t
T T T
T F F
F T F
F F T

We set the "s" statements to be true.
And we'd like to say that the condition q->r is true.
Therefore, we must show two conclusions:
1) We'd like to say that "t" could be true. (possibility)
2) And we'd like to say that for what was said in "s", the value of "t" will always be true.
3) And we'd like to say that what is said in "t" follows from what was said in "s". That the antecedent "s" implies the consequent "t".

We don't want to prove the fourth row of the conditional truth table because we considered "s" to be true, in our proof.

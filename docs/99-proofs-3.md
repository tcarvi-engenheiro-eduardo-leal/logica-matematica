Hypothesis:
h: The product of two consecutive positive integers is always even

Statements:
q: There exist "a" and it belongs to the set of positive integers
r: By the order principle, proved by the method of induction, I can say that "b" is the next positive integer after "a".

Definitions:
- To be the next positive integer means that it is equal to the antecedent integer after its sum to element 1.
- To be an even positive integer means that its division by 2 results in other positive integer.
- To be divisible by 2, in the set of positive integers, means that it is an even positive integer.

I would like to prove that the following conditional statement is true:
if q and r then h
Or, using logic symbols, q ^ r -> h
From the truth table of the conditional operator, we know the following truth table:
q^r h (q^r)->h
T   T T
T   F F
F   T F
F   F T

I considered that q^r is always true, so I only need to prove that:

The statement h is always true by what is said in the logical sentence q^r.
That what is said in "h" follows from what is said in "q^r". That the antecedent "q^r" implies the consequent "h".
To prove the hypothesis, I need to show that if "a" is a positive integer, and "b" is the next positive integer after "a", then the product of "a" and "b" is always even. This can be shown by performing arithmetic operations on the two positive integers and showing that the product is divisible by 2.
